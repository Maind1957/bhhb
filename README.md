# Burp HTTP history browser (BHHB)

View HTTP history exported from Burp Suite Community Edition(CE).

‚û°Ô∏è **https://adityatelange.github.io/bhhb/**

## What problem does this solve?
- `Burp Suite Community Edition` has one BIG feature paywalled - Disk-based projects üíæ.
- Because of which Community Edition users cannot save their `HTTP history` and Sitemap info, which are destroyed after the temporary session is closed üóëÔ∏è.
- Although this is a thing, users can export their Burp CE's HTTP history by *selecting the records* (Ctrl+A) and using **`Save items`** üíæ option in context menu of `Proxy->HTTP history` or `Target->Sitemap` or `Logger`.
- Using that Burp will export the HTTP history along with Requests and Responses into a *XML file*.
- **`BHHB`** can open these exported items, parse it and display them in a well-formatted manner. üìã
- This application is a [`PWA`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), which can be installed in any chromium based browser and could run offline, with all of the processing done on device itself ‚öôÔ∏è.
